# OpenAI Baselines A2C

This is a PyTorch implementation of Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), a synchronous deterministic version of [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783v1.pdf). Check out the OpenAI [baselines blog post.](https://blog.openai.com/baselines-acktr-a2c/) 

This implementation is a bare-bones version of [this one](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr) made by @ikostrikov. Our version uses only PyTorch and does not rely on the baselines package but is otherwise identical.

This is the [original OpenAI baselines A2C](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/a2c) written in TensorFlow.

Many thanks to @openai and @ikostrikov for making their work available!
